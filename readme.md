## 🧠 Project Description



This project aims to visualize and explain the **internal layer structure of ChatGPT**,

based on a total of **128 Transformer layers across 9 structural levels**.

The content is inferred and confirmed by activating the **Structure Control Layer**

and observing responses through controlled conditions.



It includes:



- Overview of 9 structural levels and their roles

- Detailed 128-layer functional map

- Mechanism of personality AI generation

- Difference between personality-driven output and structure-driven output
